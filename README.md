# K-Means-Clustering

### Research question: What is the ideal number of clusters to partition the data into groups to determine the important patient characteristics and patient variables to target treatment to patients?

### Steps:

#### 1. Import the data.

#### 2. Remove categorical data.

#### 3. Get summary statistics.

#### 4. Standardize the dataset.

#### 5. Initalize K-Means and assign clusters.

#### 6. Create scree plot to show the number of clusters to assign.

#### 7. Visualize clusters.

#### Outcome: Based on the outcome, I need to revisit the dataset to reduce the dimensionality and potentially transform some of the features to better represent the variability in the data.
